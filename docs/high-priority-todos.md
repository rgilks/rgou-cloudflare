## Critical Bugs (Fix First)

### 1. WASM Weight Persistence Bug

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
**Impact**: AI may be using random weights instead of trained ones

**Problem**:

- `get_ml_ai_move()` creates new `MLAI` instance on every call
- Weights are loaded but instance is discarded immediately
- TypeScript expects persistence but Rust doesn't maintain it

**Solution**:

- ‚úÖ Added global static `MLAI` instance in Rust using `lazy_static`
- ‚úÖ Modified `load_ml_weights()` to store in global instance
- ‚úÖ Modified `get_ml_ai_move()` to use global instance
- ‚úÖ Added error handling for uninitialized AI
- ‚úÖ Added `lazy_static` dependency to Cargo.toml

**Files**: `worker/rust_ai_core/src/wasm_api.rs`, `worker/rust_ai_core/Cargo.toml`

**Implementation**: The fix uses a global `Mutex<Option<MLAI>>` that persists the loaded weights between function calls, ensuring the AI actually uses the trained weights instead of random ones.

### 2. Training Loss Function Issue

**Status**: üü° Important
**Impact**: Policy network may not be learning effectively

**Problem**:

- Policy network applies softmax in definition AND uses CrossEntropyLoss
- This can cause incorrect training signals

**Solution**:

- [ ] Remove final softmax from `PolicyNetwork` definition
- [ ] Use raw logits with CrossEntropyLoss
- [ ] Verify training convergence improves
- [ ] Retrain model with corrected loss function

**Files**: `ml/scripts/train_ml_ai.py`

## Performance Improvements

### 3. Enhanced Training Data Generation

**Status**: üü° Performance
**Impact**: Faster training data generation, better scalability

**Problem**:

- Per-move subprocess calls create significant overhead
- Thousands of subprocess launches during data generation

**Solution**:

- [ ] Add `simulate_complete_game()` function in Rust
- [ ] Return entire game trajectory in one call
- [ ] Modify Python script to call once per game
- [ ] Reduce inter-process communication overhead

**Files**: `worker/rust_ai_core/src/lib.rs`, `ml/scripts/train_ml_ai.py`

### 4. Better Value Targets

**Status**: üü° Quality
**Impact**: More informative training signal

**Problem**:

- Current value target (piece count difference) is crude
- Doesn't capture strategic nuances

**Solution**:

- [ ] Use Classic AI's evaluation function as value targets
- [ ] Scale Classic AI scores appropriately
- [ ] Train value network to mimic Classic AI evaluation
- [ ] Retrain model with better targets

**Files**: `ml/scripts/train_ml_ai.py`

## Code Quality & Documentation

- [ ] Save training metadata (hyperparameters, loss curves)
- [ ] Document environment requirements

**Files**: `ml/scripts/train_ml_ai.py`

### 6. Continuous Evaluation Script

**Status**: üü¢ Testing
**Impact**: Track AI performance improvements

**Solution**:

- [ ] Create automated testing script
- [ ] Pit ML AI against Classic AI for 100+ games
- [ ] Report win rates and move quality metrics
- [ ] Integrate into development workflow

**Files**: Create new evaluation scripts

### 7. Refactor Training Script

**Status**: üü¢ Maintainability
**Impact**: Better code organization and testability

- [ ] Separate data generation, model definition, training logic
- [ ] Improve code organization
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual components

**Files**: `ml/scripts/train_ml_ai.py` ‚Üí multiple smaller files
