# AI System Documentation

This document describes the two primary AI opponents available in the Royal Game of Ur.

## Overview

The game features two distinct AI opponents, each with a unique playstyle and architecture:

- **Classic AI (Expectiminimax)**: A traditional, deterministic game-playing AI that uses the expectiminimax algorithm.
- **ML AI (Neural Network)**: A modern, experimental AI powered by a neural network trained through self-play.

At the start of each game, players can choose which AI to play against, or they can watch the two AIs play against each other.

## Classic AI: Expectiminimax

The Classic AI is the default and most robust opponent. It uses the expectiminimax algorithm, an extension of minimax designed for two-player games with an element of chance, like dice rolls.

### Core Algorithm

- **Minimax**: For deterministic game states where players make choices.
- **Expectation Nodes**: For chance-based events (dice rolls), where the AI calculates the expected value of a move based on the probability of each outcome.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A powerful optimization that prunes large portions of the search tree that cannot influence the final decision.

### Dice Probabilities

The AI uses the following probabilities for the four tetrahedral dice:

| Roll | Probability |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0    | 1/16        |
| 1    | 4/16        |
| 2    | 6/16        |
| 3    | 4/16        |
| 4    | 1/16        |

### Position Evaluation

The evaluation function is hand-crafted to assess the strategic value of a board state. Key factors include:

- **Piece Advantage**: Number of pieces on the board vs. the opponent.
- **Piece Advancement**: How far pieces have moved along their track.
- **Rosette Control**: Occupying safe squares that grant extra turns.
- **Threats**: Potential captures on the next turn.

## ML AI: Neural Network

The ML AI offers a different kind of challenge, with a playstyle developed from observing thousands of games.

See the [ML AI System Documentation](./ml-ai-system.md) for a detailed breakdown of its architecture, training process, and performance.

## AI vs. AI Mode

In this mode, the Classic AI (Player 1) plays against the ML AI (Player 2). This provides an opportunity to observe the strategic differences between the two AI systems. The game proceeds automatically, with each AI taking its turn until a winner is decided.

## Performance

| AI Type    | Search Depth | Notes                                       |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Classic AI | 6-ply        | Runs locally in the browser via WebAssembly |
| ML AI      | N/A          | Relies on a neural network for evaluation   |
