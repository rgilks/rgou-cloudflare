- **Slowest AI**: ML AI (35.7-46.4ms/move)

## Strategic Insights

### 1. Game Complexity

The fact that Random AI can achieve 48-50% win rates against expectiminimax AIs indicates the game has a significant luck component, making it less deterministic than chess or similar games.

### 2. Optimal Depth

EMM-1's superior performance suggests that for this game, a single-ply search provides the best balance of performance and speed. Deeper searches may be overthinking the position.

### 3. ML AI Potential

ML AI shows competitive performance but suffers from speed issues. With optimization, it could become a strong contender.

### 4. Heuristic AI Limitations

Heuristic AI's poor performance against expectiminimax AIs validates the importance of look-ahead algorithms, even at shallow depths.

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Primary choice**: EMM-1 (best performance/speed ratio)
2. **Alternative**: EMM-2 (if slightly more strength needed)
3. **Avoid**: EMM-3 (diminishing returns), ML AI (too slow)

### For Development

1. **Fast iteration**: EMM-1 or EMM-2
2. **Baseline testing**: Random AI
3. **Educational**: Heuristic AI

### For Research

1. **ML AI improvement**: Focus on speed optimization
2. **Depth analysis**: Investigate why deeper searches underperform
3. **Hybrid approaches**: Combine ML evaluation with expectiminimax search

## Conclusion

The comprehensive matrix analysis reveals that:

1. **EMM-1 is the optimal choice** for production use, providing the best balance of strength and speed
2. **Depth search is crucial** but diminishing returns set in quickly
3. **ML AI shows promise** but needs speed optimization
4. **Game has significant luck component** making it less deterministic than expected
5. **Heuristic AI validates** the importance of look-ahead algorithms

This analysis provides a solid foundation for AI selection and future development efforts.
