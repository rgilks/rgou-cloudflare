# Genetic Algorithm Research for Royal Game of Ur AI

## Overview

This document outlines the research and implementation of a genetic algorithm approach to optimize heuristic parameters for the Royal Game of Ur AI system. The goal was to evolve optimal values for the arbitrary constants used in the heuristic evaluation function through self-play evolution.

## Problem Statement

The original heuristic AI used arbitrary constants for various game factors:

```rust
const WIN_SCORE: i32 = 10000;
const FINISHED_PIECE_VALUE: i32 = 1000;
const POSITION_WEIGHT: i32 = 15;
const SAFETY_BONUS: i32 = 25;
const ROSETTE_CONTROL_BONUS: i32 = 40;
const ADVANCEMENT_BONUS: i32 = 5;
const CAPTURE_BONUS: i32 = 35;
const CENTER_LANE_BONUS: i32 = 2;
```

These values were chosen intuitively but had no theoretical or empirical basis for optimality.

## Solution: Genetic Algorithm with Self-Play

### Approach

1. **Individual Representation**: Each individual represents a set of 8 heuristic parameters
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: Individuals compete against each other in self-play games
3. **Parallel Evolution**: Multiple games run simultaneously using Rust's concurrency
4. **Selection**: Tournament selection to choose parents for reproduction
5. **Crossover**: Uniform crossover to combine parent parameters
6. **Mutation**: Gaussian mutation to explore parameter space
7. **Elitism**: Best individual preserved across generations

### Implementation Details

#### Core Components

- **`HeuristicParams`**: Represents the 8 parameters as a struct
- **`GeneticIndividual`**: Individual with parameters, fitness, and game statistics
- **`GeneticAI`**: AI that uses evolved parameters for move selection
- **`GeneticAlgorithm`**: Orchestrates the evolution process

#### Key Features

- **Thread-safe evaluation**: Uses Rust's thread system for parallel game evaluation
- **Configurable parameters**: Population size, mutation rate, tournament size, games per individual
- **Serialization support**: Parameters can be saved/loaded for analysis
- **WASM integration**: Genetic AI available through WebAssembly API

### Evolution Results

After 50 generations with the following configuration:

- Population size: 20
- Mutation rate: 10%
- Tournament size: 3
- Games per individual: 10

**Best evolved parameters:**

```
win_score: 7286 (was 10000)
finished_piece_value: 1104 (was 1000)
position_weight: 34 (was 15)
safety_bonus: 27 (was 25)
rosette_control_bonus: 12 (was 40)
advancement_bonus: 14 (was 5)
capture_bonus: 26 (was 35)
center_lane_bonus: 5 (was 2)
```

**Key insights from evolution:**

- **Position weight increased significantly** (15 → 34): Board position is more important than initially thought
- **Rosette control bonus decreased** (40 → 12): Rosette control is less critical than expected
- **Advancement bonus increased** (5 → 14): Piece advancement is more valuable
- **Win score decreased** (10000 → 7286): Lower win threshold may prevent over-optimization

- Larger population sizes (50-100 individuals)
- More games per individual (20-50 games)

### 2. Parameter Space Exploration

- Test different mutation rates and strategies
- Experiment with different crossover operators
- Implement adaptive mutation rates

### 3. Hybrid Approaches

- Combine genetic algorithm with expectiminimax search
- Use genetic algorithm to optimize search depth selection
- Evolve neural network architectures

### 4. Advanced Selection Methods

- Use multi-objective optimization (strength vs speed)
- Add coevolution with different AI types

## Conclusion

The genetic algorithm successfully evolved heuristic parameters that significantly outperform the original arbitrary values. The evolved genetic AI shows:
