- **Educational**: Use Heuristic AI - 50.8% win rate, instant speed
- **ML AI**: Use ML-v2 - 50% win rate vs EMM, competitive performance

## Historical Investigations

### 1. Heuristic AI Perspective Bug (2024)

**Problem**: The heuristic AI had inconsistent player perspective - both Player 1 and Player 2 were maximizing, creating unpredictable behavior.

**Investigation**:

- Analyzed evaluation function implementation
- Compared behavior against expectiminimax AI
- Identified inconsistent optimization direction

**Fix**:

- Player 1 minimizes, Player 2 maximizes (consistent with expectiminimax)
- Updated evaluation function to use consistent perspective

**Result**: Heuristic AI now performs at expected baseline level (50.8% win rate)

### 2. Transposition Table Interference (2024)

**Problem**: Shared transposition table between different search depths gave unfair advantage to depth 1, as it could access cached results from deeper searches.

**Investigation**:

- Ran depth vs depth comparisons
- Analyzed transposition table hit rates
- Identified shared state causing unfair comparisons

**Fix**:

- Separate AI instances for each depth comparison
- Clear transposition table between test runs

**Result**: Fair comparisons between different search depths, revealing true performance characteristics

### 3. Depth Performance Anomalies (2024)

**Problem**: Depth 2 was performing better than depth 3 in some scenarios, contradicting expected behavior.

**Investigation**:

- Comprehensive matrix analysis of all AI types
- Detailed performance benchmarking
- Evaluation function analysis

**Findings**:

- Tactical evaluation > deep search for Royal Game of Ur
- High luck component reduces benefits of deep search
- Evaluation function scaling issues identified

**Result**: Confirmed that shallow search with good evaluation is optimal for this game

### Depth vs Depth Comparisons (Historical)

| Comparison   | Winner  | Win Rate | Improvement |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Depth 2 vs 3 | Depth 3 | 56.7%    | Significant |
| Depth 2 vs 4 | Depth 4 | 56.7%    | Significant |
| Depth 3 vs 4 | Depth 4 | 53.3%    | Minimal     |

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Evaluation Function

**Before**:

```rust
let p1_finished = self.player1_pieces.iter().filter(|p| p.square == 20).count() as i32;
let p2_finished = self.player2_pieces.iter().filter(|p| p.square == 20).count() as i32;
```

**After**:

```rust
let mut p1_finished = 0;
let mut p2_finished = 0;

for piece in &self.player1_pieces {
    if piece.square == 20 {
        p1_finished += 1;
    }
}

for piece in &self.player2_pieces {
    if piece.square == 20 {
        p2_finished += 1;
    }
}
```

        .iter()
        .map(|&m| {
            let mut test_state = state.clone();
            if test_state.make_move(m).is_ok() {
                (m, test_state.evaluate() as f32)
            } else {
                (m, 0.0)
            }
        })
        .collect();

    let is_maximizing = state.current_player == Player::Player2;
    if is_maximizing {
        move_scores.sort_by(|a, b| b.1.partial_cmp(&a.1).unwrap_or(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal));
    } else {
        move_scores.sort_by(|a, b| a.1.partial_cmp(&b.1).unwrap_or(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal));
