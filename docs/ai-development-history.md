The v2 model, trained with only 1,000 games, significantly outperforms newer models trained with 5-10x more data. This suggests that training data quality and methodology are more important than raw quantity.

### 2. Validation Loss ≠ Competitive Performance

Models with excellent validation loss (like v4 with 0.707) can still perform poorly in competitive play. This highlights the importance of testing against strong opponents rather than relying solely on validation metrics.

### 3. Simpler Architectures Can Be Better

The v2 model's success with a relatively simple architecture suggests that complex models aren't always necessary for good performance in this domain.
