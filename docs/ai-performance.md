# AI Performance

_Current performance data for all AI systems in the Royal Game of Ur._

## üéØ Key Findings (January 2025)

**Comprehensive testing reveals significant performance differences:**

- **EMM-4 (Depth 4)**: 75.0% win rate vs ML-v2 - **üèÜ Strongest AI** but slow (370ms/move)
- **EMM-3 (Depth 3)**: 70.0% win rate vs ML-v2 - **‚ö° Production choice** for speed (15ms/move)
- **EMM-2 (Depth 2)**: 98.0% win rate vs ML-v2 - **Fast alternative** with instant speed
- **ML-v2 AI**: 49.0% win rate vs EMM-3 - **Competitive alternative** playstyle
- **Heuristic AI**: 40.0% win rate vs EMM-1 - **Educational only**, significantly weaker

**üèÜ Strongest AI**: **EMM-4 (Depth 4)** - Maximum strength for analysis and research
**‚ö° Production Choice**: **EMM-3 (Depth 3)** - Used in game and training for speed

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: EMM-2 shows anomalous 98% win rate vs ML-v2 but loses to EMM-3 in direct comparison. This suggests ML-v2 may have specific weaknesses against EMM-2's playstyle, but EMM-3 and EMM-4 are objectively stronger.
