## 🚀 Latest Training Options

### PyTorch Training (Recommended)

```bash
# Quick test (100 games, 10 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch:test

# Standard training (1000 games, 50 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch

# Fast training (500 games, 25 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch:fast

# Production training (2000 games, 75 epochs)
npm run train:pytorch:production

# v5 training (2000 games, 100 epochs, ~30 min)
npm run train:pytorch:v5
```

### Rust Training (Legacy)

```bash
# Quick test (100 games, 5 epochs)
npm run train:rust:quick

# Standard training (1000 games, 50 epochs)
npm run train:rust

# Production training (5000 games, 100 epochs)
npm run train:rust:production
```

## 🧬 Genetic Parameter Evolution

You can evolve and validate the genetic parameters for the classic AI using the following scripts:

```bash
# Evolve new genetic parameters (runs Rust evolution, saves to ml/data/genetic_params/evolved.json)
npm run evolve:genetic-params

# Validate evolved parameters against default (runs 100 games, prints win rates)
npm run validate:genetic-params
```

### Evolution Process

The evolution script uses a robust genetic algorithm with:

- **Population size:** 50 individuals
- **Generations:** 50 generations
- **Games per evaluation:** 100 games per individual
- **Post-evolution validation:** 1000 games to confirm improvement
- **Quality threshold:** Only saves parameters if they win >55% vs defaults

### Current Results (July 2025)

**Evolved Parameters Performance:**

- **Win rate vs defaults:** 61% (significant improvement)
- **Evolution time:** ~42 minutes
- **Validation confirmed:** 1000-game test showed 69.4% win rate

**Key Parameter Changes:**

- `win_score`: 10000 → 8354 (-1646)
- `finished_piece_value`: 1000 → 638 (-362)
- `position_weight`: 15 → 30 (+15)
- `rosette_control_bonus`: 40 → 61 (+21)
- `capture_bonus`: 35 → 49 (+14)

The evolved parameters significantly outperform the defaults and are now used in production.
