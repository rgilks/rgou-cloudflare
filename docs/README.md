## Documentation Organization

### Current vs Historical

- **Current System**: Documents that describe the current implementation and are actively maintained
- **Historical**: Documents that preserve historical information for reference but are not actively updated

### Categories

- **Core System**: Main system components and architecture
- **Development & Operations**: Tools, processes, and operational concerns
- **Historical**: Past experiments and findings

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Current System Documentation

- Update when features change
- Keep performance data current
- Ensure accuracy with implementation
- Add new documents for new features

### Historical Documentation

- Preserve for reference
- Don't update unless correcting factual errors
- Use for learning from past experiments
- Reference in current documentation when relevant
