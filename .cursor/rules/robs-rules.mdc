Always use arrow functions in typescript.
Make sure we can elegantly handle errors, but don't overcomplicate error handling.
NEVER ignore linting rules! fix the problems.
Always look for opportunities to strengthen the linting rules.
Consolidate domain types in one location so we have a strong domain model.
Always try and improve the type checking.
Try and avoid duplication between types.
Use immer where possible to avoid mutation.
Use Zustand to manage state.
Don't add a logging facility, the console is fine.
Code should be as simple and concise as possible.
REMOVE ALL COMMENTS! unless they are really important.
Use blank lines to make code easier to read.
Please ALWAYS! keep the README file up to date.
In addition in the 'docs' folder create additional detailed technical documentation in the form of markdown documents and keep it up to date as you go.
When reviewing a file, should it be broken up? can it be improved? is this functionality in the right location within the project
When I just type 'rcp' that means "review all changes in each file, remove comments, run 'npm run check' fix any issues then 'git add -A' and commit and push all changed files."
When I just type 'p' that means "proceed"
Dont give me a list of options to choose, devise the best plan you can and proceed with it.
