A modern web implementation of the ancient Royal Game of Ur (2500 BCE) with dual AI opponents, offline support, and beautiful animations. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Rust, and WebAssembly.

## üéÆ Play Now

**[Play Online](https://rgou.tre.systems/)** - Works in any modern browser, no installation required.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual AI System**: Classic expectiminimax + Neural network
- **Browser-Native**: All AI runs locally via WebAssembly
- **Offline Support**: PWA with full offline gameplay
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with animations and sound effects

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org/)) - Required for Next.js 15
- **Rust & Cargo** ([Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)) - For WebAssembly compilation
- **wasm-pack**: `cargo install wasm-pack --version 0.12.1 --locked` - For WASM builds

**Note**: This project was developed on an M1 Mac. While it should work on other platforms, some optimizations (especially for ML training) are specifically tuned for Apple Silicon.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rgilks/rgou-cloudflare.git
cd rgou-cloudflare

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up local database
npm run migrate:local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The game will open at http://localhost:3000

### First Run Notes

- The first run may take longer as it builds WebAssembly assets
- If you encounter WASM build issues, run: `npm run build:wasm-assets`
- For ML training, you'll also need Python 3.10+ (see [ML AI System](./docs/ml-ai-system.md))

### Common Setup Issues

- **WASM Build Failures**: Ensure wasm-pack version 0.12.1 is installed
- **Database Issues**: Run `npm run migrate:local` to set up local SQLite
- **Dependency Issues**: Try `npm run nuke` to reset the environment

See [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for detailed solutions.

## ü§ñ AI System

The project features two distinct AI opponents:

- **Classic AI**: Expectiminimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- **ML AI**: Neural network trained through self-play

Both AIs run entirely in the browser via WebAssembly. See [AI System](./docs/ai-system.md) and [ML AI System](./docs/ml-ai-system.md) for details.

## üß† Machine Learning

Train and improve the neural network AI with the optimized hybrid Rust+Python system:

```bash
# Quick test
npm run train:ml:test

# Standard training
npm run train:ml

# Production training
npm run train:ml:production

# Custom training
python ml/scripts/train_hybrid.py --num-games 2000 --epochs 75 --depth 4 --verbose
```

**Optimized Features:**
- **ü¶Ä Rust Data Generation**: Fast parallel game simulation using all CPU cores
- **üî• Python GPU Training**: Efficient neural network training with PyTorch
- **‚ö° Maximum CPU Utilization**: Uses all available cores for data generation
- **üìä Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs saved to `~/Desktop/rgou-training-data/logs/`
- **üìÅ Organized Storage**: Training data and weights stored in `~/Desktop/rgou-training-data/`

See [ML AI System](./docs/ml-ai-system.md) for complete training guide.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run check

# Quick tests (10 games)
npm run test:rust:quick

# Comprehensive tests (100 games)
npm run test:rust:slow

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

See [Testing Strategy](./docs/testing-strategy.md) for detailed testing information.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: Rust compiled to WebAssembly (client-side only)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle ORM
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages with GitHub Actions

The project evolved from hybrid client/server AI to pure client-side execution for optimal performance and offline capability. See [Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture-overview.md) for detailed system design.
