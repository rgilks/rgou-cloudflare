## üåü Features

- **Authentic Gameplay**: A faithful recreation of the 4,500-year-old Royal Game of Ur.
- **Dual AI Engine**:
  - **Client AI (Default)**: A high-performance Rust AI compiled to WebAssembly, running in the browser for instant responses and offline play. Uses expectiminimax algorithm with 6-ply search depth.
  - **Server AI (Fallback)**: The same core Rust AI logic deployed on Cloudflare Workers for consistent performance. Uses 4-ply search depth for faster response times.
- **PWA & Offline Ready**: Installable as a Progressive Web App with client-side AI for full offline gameplay.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A beautiful, responsive interface built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion animations.
- **Real-time Gameplay**: Smooth animations and real-time game state updates with immersive sound effects.
- **Celebration Effects**: Dynamic visual celebrations with screen shake, particle explosions, and triumphant sounds when pieces reach home.
- **Intuitive Controls**: AI pieces are non-interactive, preventing accidental clicks and ensuring clear game flow.
- **Detailed Game Analytics**: The AI provides detailed insights into its decision-making process.
- **Game Statistics**: Track your wins, losses, and win rate across all games played.

## üéØ Game Rules

The Royal Game of Ur is a 4,500-year-old race game where each player tries to move all 7 pieces around the board and off the finish before their opponent.

**Quick Rules:**

- **Dice**: Roll 4 tetrahedral dice (binary dice). Count marked corners facing up (0-4).
- **Movement**: Move pieces along your designated track from start to finish.
- **Combat**: Landing on an opponent's piece sends it back to start (except on rosette squares).
- **Rosettes**: Starred squares are safe zones and grant an extra turn.
- **Winning**: First player to move all 7 pieces off the board wins.

For complete rules, historical context, and strategic guidance, see the [Game Rules and Strategy Guide](./docs/game-rules-strategy.md).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses a unique dual-AI architecture, allowing the user to switch seamlessly between a server-side and client-side AI. The core AI logic is shared in the `worker/rust_ai_core` crate, ensuring consistent AI behavior across both platforms. At present only the client AI is used in production as it's cheaper to run.

- **Client AI (Default)**: The same core Rust AI logic compiled to **WebAssembly (Wasm)** runs directly in the browser. It uses a deeper search (6 plies), making it the **stronger** opponent. This also enables **offline play**.
- **Server AI (Fallback)**: A Rust AI on **Cloudflare Workers**. Due to the short compute time limits of serverless functions, this AI has a lower search depth (4 plies), making it a faster but weaker opponent.

### AI Algorithm

The AI uses the **Expectiminimax** algorithm, an extension of minimax for games with chance elements (dice rolls). It combines:

- **Minimax search** for deterministic game states
- **Expectation nodes** for probabilistic dice roll outcomes
- **Alpha-beta pruning** for search optimization
- **Transposition tables** for position caching
- **Quiescence search** to avoid horizon effects

For detailed technical information about the AI system, evaluation function, and academic references, see the [AI System Documentation](./docs/ai-system.md).

For a more detailed explanation of the overall architecture, please see the [Architecture Overview](./docs/architecture-overview.md) document.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is designed for a seamless deployment experience to the Cloudflare ecosystem, leveraging OpenNext to adapt the Next.js application for Cloudflare Pages.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command uses the `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter to compile the Next.js application and package it into the `.open-next` directory, which is optimized for deployment on Cloudflare. This single command handles both the frontend application and the WebAssembly assets.

### Local Deployment from Your Machine

You can deploy the application directly from your local machine using the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI.

1.  **Ensure you are logged in to Wrangler:**
    ```bash
    npx wrangler login
    ```
2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
3.  **Deploy the application:**
    ```bash
    npx wrangler deploy
    ```
    This command will upload the contents of the `.open-next` directory to Cloudflare Pages.

### Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

Deployment is automated via a GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. The workflow is triggered on every push to the `main` branch and performs the following steps:

1.  Checks out the code.
2.  Sets up Node.js and Rust environments.
3.  Installs dependencies.
4.  Builds the application using `npm run build`.
5.  Deploys to Cloudflare using the `wrangler-action`.

## üìö Historical Context

The Royal Game of Ur dates back to 2600-2400 BCE and was discovered in the Royal Cemetery at Ur by Sir Leonard Woolley. The game's rules were deciphered from a cuneiform tablet by Irving Finkel at the British Museum.

## Development vs Production UI

Certain buttons are only visible when running locally (localhost or 127.0.0.1):

- Switch AI (server/client)
- Restart game
- Test end game state (trophy icon)

These are hidden in production for normal users, but can be re-enabled for testing or admin by adjusting the environment detection in `src/lib/utils.ts`.

The "How to Play" and sound toggle buttons are always visible.
